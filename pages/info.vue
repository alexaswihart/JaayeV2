        Jaaye is an alternative rock and pop band from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
        Formed in May 2023 by Hunter Badamo and Ben Swihart, Jaaye quickly made 
        their mark with the self-produced record "Head To The Sun." Since their 
        debut, the band has played numerous promotional shows across Pennsylvania, 
        recorded and released new music, and inspired a growing fan base to join 
        them on their musical journey.
